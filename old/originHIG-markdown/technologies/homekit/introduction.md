In iOS, the Home app also lets users manage and configure accessories.

Your iOS, tvOS, or watchOS app can integrate with HomeKit (and by extension the Home app) to provide a custom or accessory-specific experience. For example, you can:

- Help people set up, name, and organize their accessories
- Enable fine-grained accessory configuration and control
- Provide access to custom accessory features
- Show people how to create powerful, hands-free automations
- Provide support
