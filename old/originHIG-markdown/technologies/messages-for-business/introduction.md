Using the Messages app, people can contact your company to ask questions, get support, schedule appointments, make payments with Apple Pay, and more.

People can use apps, features, and services like Maps and Spotlight to discover businesses and seamlessly initiate conversations with them. The familiar Messages app interface on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch ensures that customer interaction is intuitive and efficient, and the informality of messaging produces a customer service experience that feels personal and meaningful.
