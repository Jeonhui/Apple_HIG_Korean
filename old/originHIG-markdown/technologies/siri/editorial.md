# **Referring to Siri and using *Hey Siri***

**Don’t refer to Siri using pronouns such as “she,” “him,” or “her.”** Ideally, just use the word *Siri*. For example, *After you add a shortcut to Siri, you can run the shortcut anytime by asking Siri*.

**Use correct capitalization and punctuation when using the term *Hey Siri*.** *Hey Siri* is two words, italicized or in quotes, with an uppercase *H* and uppercase *S*. Do not follow the term with an ellipsis.

# **Referring to Shortcuts**

**When referring to the Shortcuts feature or app, always typeset with a capital S and make sure that *Shortcuts* is plural.** For example, *MyApp integrates with Shortcuts to provide a quick way to get things with just a tap or by asking Siri.*

**When referring to individual shortcuts (that is, not the feature or the Shortcuts app), use lower case.** For example, *Run a shortcut by asking Siri or tapping a suggestion on the Lock Screen*.

**Use the right terminology when describing how people can use Shortcuts in your app.**People run shortcuts by asking Siri, so your wording should be very similar to phrases like *Run a shortcut by asking Siri* or *Run the shortcut by asking Siri with your personalized phrase* (localized as appropriate). Avoid using phrases like *add voice shortcuts*, *make a voice command*, *create a voice prompt*, or any other variation. Instead, consider a phrase like *Add a shortcut to Siri to run with your voice* (localized as appropriate).

To encourage people to create or use shortcuts in ways other than voice — such as for automations, Home Screen shortcuts, and other methods — use a phrase that doesn't specify a particular method, like *For quick access, add to Shortcuts*.

**NOTE**Use translations of your app name and the word *Shortcuts* — but not *Siri* — when referring to them in a localized context.
