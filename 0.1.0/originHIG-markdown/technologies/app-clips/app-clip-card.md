# **Creating artwork and copy for the App Clip card**

The system-provided App Clip card is people’s first interaction with your App Clip, so give careful consideration to its imagery and copy.

**Be informative.** The image on the App Clip card should clearly communicate the features offered by your App Clip, supported tasks, or content.

**Prefer photography and graphics.** Avoid using a screenshot of your app’s user interface because it’s unlikely to communicate the purpose of your App Clip. Instead, use imagery that helps people understand the App Clip’s value, or a photo of the location of its associated business or point of interest.

**Avoid using text.** Text in the header image isn’t localizable, can be difficult to read, and can make a card image less aesthetically pleasing.

**Adhere to image requirements.** Use a 1800x1200 px PNG or JPEG image without transparency.

**Use concise copy.** An App Clip card requires both a title and a subtitle. Express the purpose of your App Clip clearly within the available space so people can read these at a glance and understand the App Clip’s purpose. Create a title that has no more than 30 characters and a subtitle that has no more than 56 characters.

**Pick a verb for the action button that best fits your App Clip.** Possible verbs are *View*, *Play*, or *Open*. Pick *View* for media, or if your App Clip provides informational or educational content. Pick *Play* for games. Choose *Open* for all other App Clips.
