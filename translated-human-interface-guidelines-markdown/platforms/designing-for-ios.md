As you begin designing your app or game for iOS, start by understanding the following fundamental device characteristics and patterns that distinguish the iOS experience. Using these characteristics and patterns to inform your design decisions can help you provide an app or game that iPhone users appreciate.

At other times, people can spend an hour or more browsing the web, playing games, or enjoying media. People typically have multiple apps open at the same time, and they appreciate switching frequently among them.

* Support interactions that accommodate the way people usually hold their device. For example, it tends to be easier and more comfortable for people to reach a control when it’s located in the middle or bottom area of the display, so it’s especially important let people swipe to navigate back or initiate actions in a list row.

* With people’s permission, integrate information available through platform capabilities in ways that enhance the experience without asking people to enter data. For example, you might accept payments, provide security through biometric authentication, or offer features that use the device’s location.

Great iPhone experiences integrate the platform and device capabilities that people value most. To help your design feel at home in iOS, prioritize the following ways to incorporate these features and capabilities.  

> 훌륭한 아이폰 경험은 사람들이 가장 중요시하는 플랫폼과 디바이스 기능을 통합한다. 디자인이 iOS에서 편안한 느낌을 받도록 하려면 다음과 같은 기능을 통합하는 방법을 우선해야 합니다.
>





* Help people focus on primary tasks and content by limiting the number of onscreen controls while making secondary details and actions discoverable with minimal interaction.

> * 최소한의 상호 작용으로 2차 세부 정보와 작업을 검색할 수 있도록 화면 제어의 수를 제한하여 사람들이 기본 작업과 내용에 집중할 수 있도록 도와줍니다.
>

* Adapt seamlessly to appearance changes — like device orientation, Dark Mode, and Dynamic Type — letting people choose the configurations that work best for them.

> * 장치 방향, 어두운 모드 및 동적 유형과 같은 외관 변화에 완벽하게 적응하여 사용자가 자신에게 가장 적합한 구성을 선택할 수 있습니다.
>

* Support interactions that accommodate the way people usually hold their device. For example, it tends to be easier and more comfortable for people to reach a control when it’s located in the middle or bottom area of the display, so it’s especially important let people swipe to navigate back or initiate actions in a list row.

> * 사람들이 보통 자신의 장치를 잡는 방식을 수용하는 상호작용을 지원한다. 예를 들어, 사람들이 컨트롤이 디스플레이의 중간 또는 하단 영역에 위치할 때 컨트롤에 도달하는 것이 더 쉽고 편안한 경향이 있으므로, 특히 사람들이 스와이프로 뒤로 이동하거나 목록 행에서 동작을 시작하도록 하는 것이 중요하다.
>

* With people’s permission, integrate information available through platform capabilities in ways that enhance the experience without asking people to enter data. For example, you might accept payments, provide security through biometric authentication, or offer features that use the device’s location.

> * 사람들의 허락을 받아 플랫폼 기능을 통해 사용 가능한 정보를 사람들에게 데이터 입력을 요청하지 않고 경험을 향상시키는 방식으로 통합합니다. 예를 들어, 결제를 수락하거나 생체 인증을 통해 보안을 제공하거나 장치의 위치를 사용하는 기능을 제공할 수 있습니다.
