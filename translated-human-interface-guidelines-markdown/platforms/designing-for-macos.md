People rely on the power, spaciousness, and flexibility of a Mac as they perform in-depth productivity tasks, view media or content, and play games, often using several apps at once.

As you begin designing your app or game for macOS, start by understanding the fundamental device characteristics and patterns that distinguish the macOS experience. Using these characteristics and patterns to inform your design decisions can help you provide an app or game that Mac users appreciate.

**App interactions.** Interactions can last anywhere from a few minutes of performing some quick tasks to several hours of deep concentration. People frequently have multiple apps open at the same time, and they expect smooth transitions between active and inactive states as they switch from one app to another.

* Leverage large displays to present more content in fewer nested levels and with less need for modality, while maintaining a comfortable information density that doesn’t make people strain to view the content they want.

> * 대형 디스플레이를 활용하여 더 적은 중첩 수준과 더 적은 형식으로 더 많은 콘텐츠를 표시하는 동시에 사용자가 원하는 콘텐츠를 보기 위해 부담을 주지 않는 편안한 정보 밀도를 유지할 수 있습니다.
>

* Let people resize, hide, show, and move your windows to fit their work style and device configuration, and support full-screen mode to help people focus in a distraction-free context.

> * 사용자가 작업 스타일과 장치 구성에 맞게 창 크기를 조정하고 숨김, 표시 및 이동할 수 있도록 하고 전체 화면 모드를 지원하여 사용자가 방해받지 않는 상황에서 집중할 수 있도록 지원합니다.
>

* Use the menu bar to give people easy access to all the commands they need to do things in your app.

> * 메뉴 모음을 사용하여 사용자가 앱에서 작업하는 데 필요한 모든 명령에 쉽게 액세스할 수 있습니다.
>

* Help people take advantage of high-precision input modes to perform pixel-perfect selections and edits.

> * 사람들이 고정밀 입력 모드를 활용하여 픽셀 단위로 완벽한 선택 및 편집을 수행할 수 있도록 도와줍니다.
>

* Handle keyboard shortcuts to help people accelerate actions and use keyboard-only work styles.

> * 키보드 단축키를 사용하여 작업을 가속화하고 키보드 전용 작업 스타일을 사용할 수 있습니다.
>

* Support personalization, letting people customize toolbars, configure windows to display the views they use most, and choose the colors and fonts they want to see in the interface.

> * 개인 설정을 지원하여 사용자가 도구 모음을 사용자 정의하고, 사용자가 가장 많이 사용하는 보기를 표시하도록 창을 구성하고, 인터페이스에서 볼 색과 글꼴을 선택할 수 있습니다.
