Right to left
=============

Support right-to-left languages like Arabic and Hebrew by reversing your interface as needed to match the reading direction of the related scripts.![A sketch of a right-aligned bulleted list within a window, suggesting an interface displayed in a right-to-left language. The image is overlaid with rectangular and circular grid lines and is tinted yellow to subtly reflect the yellow in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/5d683460f2af897b631f4dad86fd3473/foundations-rtl-intro@2x.png)

When people choose a language for their device — or just your app or game — they expect the interface to adapt in various ways (to learn more, see [Localization](https://developer.apple.com/localization/)
).

System-provided UI frameworks support right-to-left (RTL) by default, allowing system-provided UI components to flip automatically in the RTL context. If you use system-provided elements and standard layouts, you might not need to make any changes to your app’s automatically reversed interface.

If you want to fine-tune your layout or enhance specific localizations to adapt to different currencies, numerals, or mathematical symbols that can occur in various locales in countries that use RTL languages, follow these guidelines.

[Text alignment](/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left#Text-alignment)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Adjust text alignment to match the interface direction, if the system doesn’t do so automatically.** For example, if you left-align text with content in the left-to-right (LTR) context, right-align the text to match the content’s mirrored position in the RTL context.

![An illustration showing a layout of text and images in an interface. Three bars that represent text are left-aligned above a rounded rectangle area. A placeholder image is centered in the area, above another bar at the bottom edge. The bar inside the area is left-aligned.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/7bdc0741a96d6e2aa88b79c64e151c8a/text-alignment-ltr-screen@2x.png)Left-aligned text in the LTR context![An illustration showing a layout of text and images in an interface.

For example, right-aligning a paragraph that consists of LTR text can make the beginning of each line difficult to see. To improve readability, continue aligning one- and two-line text blocks to match the reading direction of the current context, but align a paragraph to match its language.

**Use a consistent alignment for all text items in a list.** To ensure a comfortable reading and scanning experience, reverse the alignment of all items in a list, including items that are displayed in a different script.

[Numbers and characters](/design/human-interface-guidelines/right-to-left#Numbers-and-characters)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Different RTL languages can use different number systems. For example, Hebrew text uses Western Arabic numerals, whereas Arabic text might use either Western or Eastern Arabic numerals. The use of Western and Eastern Arabic numerals varies among countries and regions and even among areas within the same country or region.

If your app focuses on mathematical concepts or other number-centric topics, it’s a good idea to identify the appropriate way to display such information in each locale you support. In contrast, apps that don’t focus on number-related topics can generally rely on system-provided number representations.

![From the left, the numerals one, two, and three in Western Arabic numerals.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/c40d3d208a9aee56d680d6915fb44fff/textformat-123-ltr@2x.png)Western Arabic numerals![From the right, the numerals one, two, and three in Eastern Arabic numerals.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/8a9f9c2f6fb291304a5d93e27be0bead/textformat-123-ar@2x.png)Eastern Arabic numerals**Don’t reverse the order of numerals in a specific number.** Regardless of the current language or the surrounding content, the digits in a specific number — such as “541,” a phone number, or a credit card number — always appear in the same order.

If you use numerals in this way, be sure to reverse the order of the numerals to match the direction of the flipped control. Also reverse a sequence of numerals if you use the sequence to communicate a specific order.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Flip controls that show progress from one value to another.** Because people tend to view forward progress as moving in the same direction as the language they read, it makes sense to flip controls like sliders and progress indicators in the RTL context. When you do this, also be sure to reverse the positions of the accompanying glyphs or images that depict the beginning and ending values of the control.

Similarly, next or previous buttons that let people access items in an ordered list need to flip in the RTL context to match the reading order.

**Preserve the direction of a control that refers to an actual direction or points to an onscreen area.** For example, if you provide a control that means “to the right,” it must always point right, regardless of the current context.

**Visually balance adjacent Latin and RTL scripts when necessary.** In buttons, labels, and titles, Arabic or Hebrew text can appear too small when next to uppercased Latin text, because Arabic and Hebrew don’t include uppercase letters. To visually balance Arabic or Hebrew text with Latin text that uses all capitals, it often works well to increase the RTL font size by about 2 points.

**Avoid flipping images like photographs, illustrations, and general artwork.** Flipping an image often changes the image’s meaning; flipping a copyrighted image could be a violation. If an image’s content is strongly connected to reading direction, consider creating a new version of the image instead of flipping the original.

**Reverse the positions of images when their order is meaningful.** For example, if you display multiple images in a specific order like chronological, alphabetical, or favorite, reverse their positions to preserve the order’s meaning in the RTL context.

**Flip an interface icon that shows forward or backward motion.** When something moves in the same direction that people read, they typically interpret that direction as forward; when something moves in the opposite direction, people tend to interpret the direction as backward. An interface icon that depicts an object moving forward or backward needs to flip in the RTL context to preserve the meaning of the motion. For example, an icon that represents a speaker typically shows sound waves emanating forward from the speaker. In the LTR context, the sound waves come from the left, so in the RTL context, the icon needs to flip to show the waves coming from the right.

![The outline of a speaker with three concentric curved lines emanating to the right.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/d43d629eea61239a9268d6616551b48c/speaker-wave-3-ltr@2x.png)LTR variant of a symbol that depicts forward motion![The outline of a speaker with three concentric curved lines emanating to the left.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/d10bb4c00b214c16a802183377134b59/speaker-wave-3-rtl@2x.png)RTL variant of a symbol that depicts forward motion**Don’t flip logos or universal signs and marks.** Displaying a flipped logo confuses people and can have legal repercussions. Always display a logo in its original form, even if it includes text. People expect universal symbols and marks like the checkmark to have a consistent appearance, so avoid flipping them.

For example, clocks work the same everywhere, so a traditional clock interface icon needs to look the same regardless of language direction. Some interface icons might seem to reference language or reading direction because they represent items that are slanted for right-handed use. However, most people are right-handed, so flipping an icon that shows a right-handed tool isn’t necessary and might be confusing.

**Before merely flipping a complex custom interface icon, consider its individual components and the overall visual balance.** In some cases, a component — like a badge, slash, or magnifying glass — needs to adhere to a visual design language regardless of localization. For example, SF Symbols maintains visual consistency by using the same backslash to represent the prohibition or negation of a symbol’s meaning in both LTR and RTL versions.

![A silhouette of a speaker pointing right with a backslash on top of it.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/d9f54801d79a03d6abc39b665a95b00d/speaker-slash-fill-ltr@2x.png)LTR variant of a symbol that includes a backslash![A silhouette of a speaker pointing left with a backslash on top of it.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/42dc822fc59ebc4c8d02d6e6c7fa0959/speaker-slash-fill-rtl@2x.png)RTL variant of a symbol that includes a backslashIn other cases, you might need to flip a component (or its position) to ensure the localized version of the icon still makes sense. For example, if a badge represents the actual UI that people see in your app, it needs to flip if your UI flips. Alternatively, if a badge modifies the meaning of an interface icon, consider whether flipping the badge preserves both the modified meaning and the overall visual balance of the icon. In the images shown below, the badge doesn’t depict an object in the UI, but keeping it in the top-right corner visually unbalances the cart.
