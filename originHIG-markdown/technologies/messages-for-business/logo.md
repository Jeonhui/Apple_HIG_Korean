# **[technologies-messages-for-business] logo**

Your logo visually identifies your business in Messages and other contexts throughout the system.

**Test your logo’s appearance in all contexts.** View your logo in the message list, conversation navigation bar, and notifications, and make sure it’s clear and distinct.

**Provide your logo in both square and wide variations.** Make sure your logo looks great everywhere by creating a separate version for each variation.

**Use adequate padding in your logo.** Unless your logo has full-bleed elements, it’s best to inset key elements from the edges by 10% of the image’s width and height.

**Avoid using colors that make it hard for people to perceive your logo.** For example, colorblind people might not be able to distinguish some color combinations, and insufficient contrast can cause icons and text to blend with the background and make content hard to read. For guidance, see [Color and effects](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/accessibility#color-and-effects).

# **Square logo**

Your square logo appears on the contact card for your business, in search results, in the message list view, and in the navigation bar of a conversation if you don’t provide a wide logo.
