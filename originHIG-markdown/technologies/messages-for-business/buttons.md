# **[technologies-messages-for-business] buttons**

Customers use Messages for Business buttons to start a conversation with your company. You can also support system features like Maps and Spotlight, so that customers can use them to locate your business and start a conversation. Other ways to help customers contact you are to:

- Enable Message Suggest on your account (see [Triggering message suggest](https://register.apple.com/resources/messages/messaging-documentation/message-suggest#triggering-message-suggest))
- Include a URL in an email message (see [Starting a message from a URL](https://register.apple.com/resources/messages/messaging-documentation/message-with-customers#starting-a-message-from-a-url))
- Add Messages for Business buttons to your app or your company’s website (see [Design your website and app for the Messages buttons](https://register.apple.com/resources/messages/messaging-documentation/message-with-customers#design-your-website-and-app-for-the-messages-buttons))

**Let people start conversations anytime.** Don’t disable buttons or links that initiate conversations outside of your business hours. Even if you only respond to customer service inquiries during certain hours, people should be able to start a conversation anytime. If a customer starts a conversation after hours when live agents aren’t available, an automated agent should send a reply letting them know when a live agent is able to respond.

The following guidelines help you use Messages for Business buttons correctly and refer appropriately to the feature in all your customer-facing communications.

# **Using Messages for Business buttons**

**Let the default button title encourage customers to contact you.** System-provided button titles like “Message Us,” “Get Help,” “Ask a Question,” or “Contact an Agent” help people understand what the button does. If you use the logo-only button, consider displaying the text "Apple Messages" near the button to help people recognize the service.

**Show the buttons on supported devices.** If a customer is using an unsupported device, don’t encourage a conversation by displaying a button — on websites, the button hides automatically when it isn’t supported. If the button is hidden, update the layout accordingly and remove the call to action or other related text.

**Make sure Messages for Business buttons are discoverable.** People generally expect to find the button on contact information, support, order confirmation, product, and order history pages.

**Display the button prominently.** Messages for Business buttons should be the same size or larger than similar contact initiation buttons, such as an email button.

**Use only approved button styles.** For guidance, see [Design your website and app to include the Messages buttons](https://register.apple.com/resources/messages/messaging-documentation/message-with-customers#design-your-website-and-app-for-the-messages-buttons).

**Maintain minimum and maximum button sizes and inner side margins.** Use the following values for guidance.

| Max width | Min height | Max height | Min side margins |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1000 pt (2000 px @2x) | 40 pt (80 px @2x) | 150 pt (300 px @2x) | 5% of height |

**Don’t make any other visual or functional modifications to buttons.** For example, don’t change transparency values or add drop shadows.

**Maintain minimum clear space.** The minimum amount of clear space required around the buttons is 10% of the button’s height. Don’t let other elements infringe on this space or occlude the button in any way.

**Maintain the minimum button size and margin values when manually placing buttons on a webpage.** You’re responsible for sizing and placing the buttons correctly.

Use the following margin values for guidance.

| Margin | Minimum value |
| --- | --- |
| Top and bottom | 15 pt (15 px @1x, 30 px @2x) |
| Left and right | 20 pt (20 px @1x, 40 px @2x) |
| Between buttons | 15 pt (15 px @1x, 30 px @2x) |

# **Referring to Apple Messages for Business**

**In general, use the terms *Apple Messages for Business* or *Apple Messages* in customer-facing communications.** Avoid using the term *Messages* by itself, especially when paired with a logo-only button.

**Use proper capitalization when mentioning *Apple Messages for Business* in headlines and copy.** Specifically, use four words with an uppercase *A*, an uppercase *M*, and an uppercase *B*, and lowercase for all other letters.

**Avoid using other terms to refer to Messages for Business in customer-facing content.** For example, avoid using the terms *chat* or *text* to refer to a Messages for Business button or flow.

**Never use the Apple logo to represent the name *Apple* in text.** Apple Messages for Business is a service mark of Apple Inc.
