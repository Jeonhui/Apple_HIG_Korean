# **Legal requirements**

Only the Apple-provided App Clip Codes created in App Store Connect or with the App Clip Code Generator command-line tool and that follow these guidelines are approved for use.

App Clip Codes are approved for use to indicate availability of an App Clip. Apple may update the App Clip Code design from time to time at Apple’s discretion.

In the event your App Clip is no longer active, you should also stop displaying the App Clip Code associated with that inactive App Clip.

You may not use the App Clip Code (including, without limitation, the Apple Logo, the App Clip mark, and the App Clip Code designs) as part of your own company name or as part of your product name. You may not seek copyright or trademark registration for the App Clip Codes or any elements contained therein.

The App Clip Codes described in these guidelines must not be used in any manner that is likely to reduce, diminish, or damage the goodwill, value, or reputation associated with Apple or App Clips; or that infringes or violates the trademarks or other proprietary rights of any third party; or that is likely to cause confusion as to the source of products or services.

Apple retains all rights to its trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights contained in the materials provided for use hereunder, including, without limitation, the App Clip Codes and any elements contained therein.

Do not add a symbol to App Clip Codes created in App Store Connect or with the App Clip Code Generator command-line tool.

Do not translate any Apple trademark. Apple trademarks must remain in English even when they appear within text in a language other than English. With Apple’s approval, a translation of the legal notice and credit lines (but not the trademarks) can be used in materials distributed outside the U.S.
