CareKit 2.0 contains two projects, CareKit UI and CareKit Store. CareKit UI provides a wide variety of prebuilt views you can use to create a custom CareKit app. CareKit Store defines a database scheme that incorporates CareKit entities — such as patients, care plans, tasks, and contacts — so you can store and manage data on the patient's device. CareKit 2.0 enables seamless synchronization between your database and the UI, so you can always keep a care plan up to date.
