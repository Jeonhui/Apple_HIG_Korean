## An image well is an editable version of an image view.

After selecting an image well, people can copy and paste its image or delete it. People can also drag a new image into an image well without selecting it first.

## **Best practices**

**Revert to a default image when necessary.** If your image well requires an image, display the default image again if people clear the content of the image well.

**If your image well supports copy and paste, enable the standard copy and paste menu items.** People generally expect to choose these menu items — or use the standard keyboard shortcuts — to interact with an image well.
