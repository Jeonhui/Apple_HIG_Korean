# **[components-status] rating-indicators**

## A rating indicator uses a series of horizontally arranged graphical symbols — by default, stars — to communicate a ranking level.

A rating indicator doesn’t display partial symbols; it rounds the value to display complete symbols only. Within a rating indicator, symbols are always the same distance apart and don't expand or shrink to fit the component's width.

In iTunes, for example, people can use a rating indicator to assign a rank to individual songs and podcast episodes. The system may reference these ratings for the purposes of searching, sorting, and creating smart playlists.

# **Best practices**

**Make it easy to change rankings.** When presenting a list of ranked items, let people adjust the rank of individual items inline without navigating to a separate editing screen.

**If you replace the star with a custom symbol, make sure that its purpose is clear.** The star is a very recognizable ranking symbol, and people may not associate other symbols with a rating scale.

# **Platform considerations**

*No additional considerations for macOS. Not supported in iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, or watchOS.*
