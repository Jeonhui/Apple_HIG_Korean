Image wells
===========

An image well is an editable version of an image view.![A stylized representation of an image well. The image is tinted red to subtly reflect the red in the original six-color Apple logo.](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/101ad769eaeccadb3758ca0b05a4fc5b/components-image-well-intro@2x.png)

After selecting an image well, people can copy and paste its image or delete it. People can also drag a new image into an image well without selecting it first.

[Best practices](/design/human-interface-guidelines/image-wells#Best-practices)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Revert to a default image when necessary.** If your image well requires an image, display the default image again if people clear the content of the image well.

**If your image well supports copy and paste, make sure the standard copy and paste menu items are available.** People generally expect to choose these menu items — or use the standard keyboard shortcuts — to interact with an image well.
